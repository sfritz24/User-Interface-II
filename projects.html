                    <p>This is an original drawing I did for fun. I drew it from scratch 
                        and proceeded to draw it digitally. The idea I had behind it was that 
                        Ditto is essentially a copycat and so I decided to put a cat costume 
                        on him and just call him "Dittocat" instead of copycat. This was also 
                        my second attempt at digital art and I'm very proud of it.</p>

                    <img src="/pictures/pottery.jpg" alt="My biggest pottery project">
                    <p>I took a pottery class in college and this was my largest project that 
                        I did. It is a full dinnerwear set so there are cups, bowls, and plates.
                         I only needed to make 4 of each but they had to be roughly the same 
                         size so I ended up making 6 total. I did that so I could pick out the 
                         best ones for submitting my finial project. There are two other pieces 
                         in the background that you can see that I did roughly at the same time. 
                         Those were also large in terms of size but they were individual projects.</p>

                    <img src="/pictures/dreambed.jpg" alt="This is the framwork for a bedframe">
                    <p>This is a custom bedframe that I desined myself. I put in many, many hours 
                        trying to figure everthing out in terms of measurements. I knew that I wanted 
                        some desks built into it and I knew that I wanted a dog bed on one side. 
                        I found the idea online and made it my own. The original used premade structures 
                        and the bed was sitting above the top of the platform. There were other things 
                        different but I just took that idea and transformed it to fit my needs and wants.</p>

                    <img src="/pictures/mask.jpg" alt="A mask I made for Halloween one year">
                    <p>This is as mask I made for Halloween one year. This mask is custom 
                        made for my face. I also made the body paint. I did that beacuse it 
                        was easier and cheaper for me to make my own waterproof makeup. I 
                        will most certianly be making more various masks in the future. This 
                        mask was spcifically meant for a tiger costume. Everyone that saw me 
                        that night loved it and anyone who could get close enough really enjoyed 
                        the fact that the nose had a very realistic texture, even if it might 
                        have freaked a few people out.</p>

                    <img src="/pictures/bracelet.jpg" alt="A bracelet I made to sell">
                    <p>I made this bracelet and many others like it to sell one day. There isn't 
                        a real story behing why I started making bracelets. The simplest explanation 
                        is that I like to try and learn new things. These kinds of bracelets are 
                        relatively easy and inexpensive to make. It was an easy way for me to learn 
                        something new without paying an arm and leg. One thing that makes this 
                        bracelet stand out is that it glows under UV light.</p>

                    <p>This is a very old desk that we had for a long time. It was rather ugly 
                        but it got the job done so we weren't going to complain. It helps that 
                        people didn't see it regularly. For a long time it was in storage, but 
                        when we wanted to move our desktop computer, we decided we should put 
                        the computer on an actual desk. Since the desk was going to be out in 
                        a common space, we wanted to give it a face lift. We were originally 
                        going to just paint it but after we sanded it and saw the wood, we 
                        ended up staining it. It's not sell-worthy but we are happy with the end result.</p>
