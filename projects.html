                    <p>This is an original drawing I did for fun. I drew it from scratch 
                        and proceeded to draw it digitally. The idea I had behind it was that 
                        Ditto is essentially a copycat and so I decided to put a cat costume 
                        on him and just call him "Dittocat" instead of copycat. This was also 
                        my second attempt at digital art and I'm very proud of it.</p>

                    <img src="/pictures/pottery.jpg" alt="My biggest pottery project">
                    <p>I took a pottery class in college and this was my largest project that 
                        I did. It is a full dinnerwear set so there are cups, bowls, and plates.
                         I only needed to make 4 of each but they had to be roughly the same 
                         size so I ended up making 6 total. I did that so I could pick out the 
                         best ones for submitting my finial project. There are two other pieces 
                         in the background that you can see that I did roughly at the same time. 
                         Those were also large in terms of size but they were individual projects.</p>

                    <img src="/pictures/dreambed.jpg" alt="This is the framwork for a bedframe">
                    <p>This is a custom bedframe that I desined myself. I put in many, many hours 
                        trying to figure everthing out in terms of measurements. I knew that I wanted 
                        some desks built into it and I knew that I wanted a dog bed on one side. 
                        I found the idea online and made it my own. The original used premade structures 
                        and the bed was sitting above the top of the platform. There were other things 
                        different but I just took that idea and transformed it to fit my needs and wants.</p>
